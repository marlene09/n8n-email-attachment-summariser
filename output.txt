MESSAGE FROM MRS SAWFORD

Half term is finally here! We have had a brilliant start to the
@ academic year. I am so proud of all the children, and how well
© they have settled into their new classes. The Nursery and
ace eo iP Reception children have quickly picked up on routines and
sk © whenever I go in to see them they are all busy with their new

friends, playing games and having lots of fun. Year 1 and Year 2
have settles into their new classes and year group routines too.

We have had some exciting things happen in school this half term. Nursery enjoyed a colourful
Elmer day, where they created their own Elmer. A lovely way to finish the week learning all about
colours. Reception made bread rolls which looked delicious! We had a lovely Harvest assembly
where our Year 2 choir performed for the first time and each year group sang a Harvest song. We
are very thankful to you for all the donations which will be passed on to the St Neots Foodbank.

‘Afternoon Tea with Mrs Sawford' will start up again after half term. This is
a lovely little celebration, bringing children together from across the school
to share work and share the lovely reasons why their teacher has chosen
them. It is a really nice opportunity to celebrate children’s successes across
the school, promoting speaking and listening skills.

Last week Year 1 and Year 2 spent the afternoon in the Junior School whilst

staff paid their respects to Mrs Ormston, a much loved colleague who sadly

passed away following a battle with Cancer. I would like to say a big thank you for all your kind
words and support for staff on this day, it was appreciated by everyone. Also a big thank you to
all the staff at Crosshall Junior School who were all just amazing in supporting us and ensuring we
could go to the funeral.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for all your support this half term. I hope you all
have a lovely half term and we look forward to seeing you all again on Tuesday 4th November.

Mrs Sawford

CROSSHALL AMAZON WISHLIST

Thank you to the many families who have made a purchase from our Amazon Wishlist, we are so
grateful.

As part of our transfer across to Meridian Trust and adopting their curriculum we are needing to
purchase a number of different books that are used throughout the curriculum. We have
purchased 1 copy of each book but we would like 1 per class. These have been added to the
wishlist. If you could purchase 1 of the books then that would support the delivery of the lessons
without needing to share books across classes.

Our Wishlist can be located here or by scanning the QR code : Amazon wish-
list . This covers basic everyday school resources which we hope you can assist
us with.

There is absolutely no pressure or expectation from the school for people to
donate through this way but it has been created in the hope that you can. If
you are unable to purchase a specific item but can purchase a similar
alternative then please do so and we are grateful.

All of these resources will make a difference!

This Week...

The children have really enjoyed learning about Harvest and Diwali. The children have been making
Diwali lanterns to hang in our nursery. They have also been busy in the magic garden finding and
collecting pumpkins. We have cut them open and the children have had fun exploring what is inside.

Today, the children went over to the school hall for the whole school Harvest assembly. They sang
Dingle Dangle Scarecrow and listened carefully to songs and readings from Reception, Year 1 and
Year 2. They sat beautifully and sang so well!

After half-term...
We will continue to learn about Autumn and celebrations. We will read the book ‘Leaf Man’.

We will also be looking talking about Bonfire night and create some spectacular firework pictures
and make rockets.

shape.

phrases to describe fireworks as well as
alliteration and onomatopoeia.

how artists explore the environment around
them and use what they see and collect to help

environment to create their own pieces of art
work.

thinking about what the best
gift you could give someone
might be, and why giving can
be so special.

to music and making comparisons. This piece of
work will be inspired by “The Magic Flute".

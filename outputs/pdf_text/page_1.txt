friends, playing games and having lots of fun. Year 1 and Year 2

We have had some exciting things happen in school this half term. Nursery enjoyed a colourful
Elmer day, where they created their own Elmer. lovely way to finish the week learning all about
colours. Reception made bread rolls which looked delicious! We had a lovely Harvest assembly
where our Year 2 choir performed for the first time and each year group sang a Harvest song. We
are very thankful to you for all the. donations which will be passed on to the St Neots Foodbank,

‘Afternoon Tea with Mrs Sawford will start up again after half term. This is
«lovely little celebration, bringing children together from across the school
to share work and share the lovely reasons why their teacher has chosen
them, It is a really nice opportunity to celebrate children’s successes across
‘the school, promoting speaking and listening skills,

Last week Year 1 and Year 2 spent the afternoon in the Junior School whilst
staff paid their respects to Mrs Ormston, a much loved colleague who sadly
passed away following a battle with Cancer. I would like to say a big thank you for all your kind
words and support for staff on this day, it was appreciated by everyone. Also a big thank you to
all the staff at Crosshall Junior School who were all just amazing in supporting us and ensuring we
could go to the funeral,

T would like to take this opportunity to thank you for all your support this half term, I hope you all
have a lovely half term and we look forward to seeing you all again on Tuesday 4th November.

CROSSHALL AMAZON WISHLIST

Thank you to the many families who have made a purchase from our Amazon Wishlist, we are So
grateful

‘As part of our transfer across to Meridian Trust and adopting their curriculum we are needing to
purchase a number of different books that are used throughout the curriculum. We have
purchased 1 copy of each book but we would like 1 per class, These have been added to the
wishlist. Tf you could purchase 1 of the books then that would support the delivery of the lessons
without needing to share books across classes.

Our Wishlist can be located here or by scanning the QR code : Ainczon wish-
ist, This covers basic everyday School resources which we hope you con assist
us with,

There is absolutely no pressure or expectation from the school for people to
[donate through this way but it has been created in the hope that you can. If
}you are unable to purchase a specific item but can purchase a similar
alternative then please do so and we are grateful

All of these resources will make a difference!

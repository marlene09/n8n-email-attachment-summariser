Crosshall Nursery

This Week...

The children have really enjoyed learning about Harvest and Diwali, The children have been making
Diwali lanterns to hang in our nursery. They have also been busy in the magic garden finding and
collecting pumpkins, We have cut them open and the children have had fun exploring what is inside.
Today, the children went over to the school hall for the whole school Harvest assembly. They sang
Dingle Dangle Scarecrow and listened carefully to songs and readings from Reception, Year 1 and
Year 2, They sat beautifully and sang so well!

‘After half-term,
We will continue to learn about Autumn and celebrations. We will read the book'Leaf Man’

‘We will also be looking talking about Bonfire night and create some spectacular firework pictures
‘and make rockets.
